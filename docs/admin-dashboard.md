- **TODO**: Implement proper admin role checking
- **Self-Protection**: Users cannot delete their own accounts

### Recommended Enhancements
1. **Role-Based Access Control**: Add admin roles to user schema
2. **Permission Levels**: Different admin permissions (read-only, moderator, super admin)
3. **Audit Logging**: Track admin actions for accountability
4. **Rate Limiting**: Prevent abuse of admin endpoints
5. **IP Restrictions**: Limit admin access to specific IP ranges
